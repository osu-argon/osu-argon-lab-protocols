## Description

Standard protocol for basalt plagioclase separation. The focus of this procedure is to separate plagioclase down to the target grain size (e.g. 150 - 250 microns). The sample is initially trimmed of alteration rinds using a steel saw followed buy crushing using a steel hammer and steel plate to break down the size of the pieces for use in a large or small jaw crusher. After the sample has been broken down into the desired grain size using a jaw crusher, the sample is sieved and washed until all fine particles are removed. Next magnetic separation methods are used to isolate the plagioclase phase from the groundmass. Plagioclase separates are leached twice using our standard procedure as well as an additional leach step using hydrofluoric acid. After acid leaching, the material is once again sieved and magnetically separated as the grains are too have likely have change after acid leaching. After the final sieve and magnetic separation, the plagioclase is picked under a binocular microscope.
