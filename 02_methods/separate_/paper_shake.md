## Procedure

![Paper Shake Separation Method](https://github.com/danielheaton/argonlabprotocols/blob/master/02_methods/separate_/images/paper_shake_01.jpeg "Paper Shake")

1. Setup your work station: an 8.5x11 sheet of paper on a tray, to catch the “discard,” and a sheet of weighing paper.
2. Pour a small amount of sample onto the weighing paper.
3. Holding the weighing paper at a shallow angle over the catch tray, gently shake the weighing paper to allow grains to fall over the edge. Sheet-like mica minerals will tend to “stick” to the weighing paper, while more blocky or irregular grains more easily fall off. Continue shaking the paper until a concentrate of mica minerals remains.
4. Transfer the mica minerals from the weighing paper to a vial (label appropriately).
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until sufficient quantity is separated. (If fingerprints or dust/fines are interfering with the separation, use a new sheet of weighing paper.)
6. Return the “discard” material on the catch tray to the sample bag, or transfer to a new bag/vial. Clean the tray and work surface when you are finished.
