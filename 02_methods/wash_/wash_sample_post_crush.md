# Wash Sample Method

## ID

`wash_sample_post_crush`

## Requires

`label_sample_beaker`

## Description

Sample is rinsed in tap water and put into an ultra-sonic bath for a few minutes. The sample is rinsed a few more times until all the finer material is washed away. Once the water is clear, a final rinse in DI water is conducted before being placed in an oven to dry at 55°C.

## Procedure
1. Select the desired size range to continue processing and wash.
2. Select a beaker size based on the size of your sample. It is best to select a beaker large enough so that it is only filled ~1/4 of the way with the sample. Selecting a beaker too small will make it more difficult to fully rinse and wash the sample and make it longer to dry in the oven.

4. Rinse the sample in tap water until water is clear. To accomplish this begin by rinsing the sample a few times to remove the loosely held dust and smaller material.
5. Fill the beaker with water and place in an ultra-sonic bath for 20 minutes.
6. After, rinse the sample until the water is clear.
7. Once the water is clear enough, drain as much water as possible and place the beaker into an oven at a temperature no greater than 55 °C. To expedite the sample drying, rinse the sample a few times with acetone and place it in the oven. The acetone will evaporate quickly and expedite the drying process.
8. After the sample is dry, re-sieve the sample before proceeding to the next step.
