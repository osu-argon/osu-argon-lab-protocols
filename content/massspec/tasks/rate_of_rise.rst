Rate of Rise
============

**Description**

This procedure is used to establish a general background level gas in the mass spectrometer. The procedure starts by isolating the mass spectrometer and closing the valve to the ion pump, allowing to gas to start building up in the mass spectrometer. The signal should slowly start to rise as gas starts building up from the sidewalls of the mass spectrometer. Before opening the extraction line up to the mass spectrometer, close the valve to the ion pump connected to the extraction line.

**Procedure**

1. Set the mass spec into the configuration shown in Figure xx.
2. Turn off `Monitor Mode` in ArArExperiments.
3. Go to `Scan Settings` and set `Integration Time` to `0.52 s`.
4. In Intrument Control go to Graph View and click `Reset Chromotagram` and `Set Time Zero`.
5. Double click `H1` on the graph and then double click the graph. It should now be reading the signal on `H1`.
6. Close the valve to `Ion Pump Mass Spec`.
7. Sample Chamber Configuration:
    a. If sample chamber valve already open to prep system, close valve between chamber and prep system.
    b. If sample chamber is valve closed and opening it to the system, leave valve open.
7. Establish a rise for `120 s`.
8. Close `Ion Pump Prep System`.
9. Let gas accumulate for another `120 s`.
10. Sample Chamber Configuration
    a. Open valve to the sample chamber.
    b. Open manual valve to sample chamber. Watch the graph to make sure there isn't too much gas being let into the mass spectrometer.
11. Let gas accumulate for another `120 s`.
12. Zoom in on the chromotagram over `60 s` time period and calculate the accumulation of gas over a that time period.
13. Record a screen shot and the rate of rise number in fA/min into the respective `Teams` Channel for the mass spectrometer that is being worked on.
