Standard Acid Leaching Procedure
================================

**ID**

`leach_standard`

**Requires**


**Description**

This acid leaching procedure removes carbonate and clay products that may interfere or contaminate Ar/Ar analyses. The procedure involves placing the sample in a sequence of acids (1N HCl, 6N HCl, 1N HNO3, 3N HNO3) and placing them in a mild ultra-sonic bath.

3. Gather supplies and PPE.

    **Personal Protection Equipment**
      - **Eyes:** Tight-fitting goggles
      - **Hands:** Viton or nitrile gloves
      - **Body:** Lab coat, long pants and closed-toed shoes
    
    HDPE Bottles
      - Use large HDPE bottles if you have lots of sample. They sit better in the bath, but beware, you will use more acid.
      - Use small HDPE bottles for small samples. They tend to tip over in the bath.
    
    Acid (best to prepare acid ahead of time)
      - 1L of 1N HCl
      - 1L of 6N HCl
      - 1L of 1N HNO3
      - 1L of 3N HNO3
    
    - 3 - 1,000 mL glass beakers (for acid waste)
    - 2 - 300 mL glass beakers (for pouring acid into and out of bottles)
    - 2 - small plastic trays

    - Set ultrasound to 50°C.

6. Line up the samples in the fume hood on one of the plastic work trays.
7. Setup two of the 1 L beakers on a small tray, next to the tray with the samples. These two beakers will be used for acid waste.
8. Take a sample and remove the cap and place the top of the cap downwards on to the plastic tray.
9. Acid Leach Step 1M HCL.
    a. Carefully pour about the acid equal to about double the volume of grains. Generally no more than half the volume of the bottle. Close the bottle and swirl the bottle for a few moments to mix.
    a. Continue adding acid for the remaining samples.
    a. Set timer on the sonic bath for **60 minutes.**.
    a. Swirl samples every **15 minutes.**
    a. If solution becomes cloudy, replace with fresh acid.
    a. Rinse at least 3 times with Milli-Q water after 60 minutes is up.
    a. Pour off acid into 1,000 mL beakers during rinse.
10. Repeat last step for each acid as well as an additional time for milli-Q water. Continue to rinse until the sample is no longer cloudy.
11. Label 300 mL glass beakers with the numbers that were used for acid leaching.
12. Transfer the samples from the bottles to the glass beakers with their respective numbers. To do this, add a small amount of milli-q water to the bottle. Swirl the water and quickly pour it into the glass beaker. Repeat to get all of the material out of the bottles.
13. Place samples in an oven to dry overnight. The oven should be at a temperature no higher than 55 C.
14. Leave it the way you found it.
15. Put all items away.
16. Clean all glass beakers with water.
17. Wipe down work surfaces.
18. Clean used LDPE bottles and beakers.
