## Description

Standard protocol for basalt groundmass separation. The focus of this procedure is to separate groundmass down to the target grain size (e.g. 150 - 250 microns). The sample is initially trimmed of alteration rinds using a steel saw followed buy crushing using a steel hammer and steel plate to break down the size of the pieces for use in a large or small jaw crusher. After the sample has been broken down into the desired grain size using a jaw crusher, the sample is sieved and washed until all fine particles are removed. Next magnetic separation methods are used to isolate the groundmass phase from phenocryst phases if they exit. A uniform and homogenous groundmass portion is selected for acid leaching. After acid leaching, the material is once again sieved and magnetically separated as the grains are too have likely have change after acid leaching. After the final sieve and magnetic separation, the groundmass is picked under a binocular microscope.  The picked groundmass grains should be representative of the rock and free of visible ateration and limited phenocrysts.
