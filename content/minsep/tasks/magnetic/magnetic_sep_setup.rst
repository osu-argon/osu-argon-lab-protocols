**Magnetic Separation Setup**

Brief description of the overall procedure. This should include important details so that the procedure could be replicated.

**Steps**

#. Wipe down all surfaces, collection cups, funnel, and track with ethanol.
#. Take extra care in wiping down the gap between the magnetic where the track is installed. There can be grains stuck to the surface of the magnet.
