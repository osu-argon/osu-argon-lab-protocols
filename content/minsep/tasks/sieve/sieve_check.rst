**Check Sieves**

In general, always check a sieve before using it to ensure that there is no cross contamination.


**Procedure**

1. Wipe down top and bottom of sieve with a tech wipe and ethanol.
2. Check for grains stuck by looking through the sieve. This is done best by using a bright background (e.g. hold up to light) in order to see grains clogging the mesh.
3. If there are grains, refer to cleaning methods in sieve_clean.
