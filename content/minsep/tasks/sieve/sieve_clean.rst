Clean Sieves
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Describes the general procedure to clean sieves before and after working with a sample.


#. Working over a sheet of paper, or directly over the rock waste bucket, scrub mesh with a fine wire or nylon brush to dislodge grains. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, which could deform the mesh.

    a. With sieve turned upside down, apply back-and-forth strokes of the brush along the strands of the mesh, in circles, etc., to dislodge as many grains as possible.

    b. Turn sieve over and repeat step (a) for the inner side of the mesh.

    c. If necessary, run a needle tool along the wire mesh to pluck out stuck grains. Do not poke/scrape/scratch with a lot of force, as this could damage the mesh.

    d. Repeat steps (a) through (c) as needed until all grains are removed.

#. Use an air hose to blow dust out of the mesh and off the metal surfaces of the sieve.
#. Give metal surfaces a final wipe down with a paper cloth and ethanol or acetone.
