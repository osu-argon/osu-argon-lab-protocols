Progression Sieving and Crushing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sieving and crushing a sample in conjunction with one another allows you to efficiently breakdown the sample.  Once the sample has been initially crushed to ~<5 mm in size, the sample should be sieved. The coarsest sieve should be taken and put back into the crusher.  This can be repeated until the jaw crusher no longer becomes efficient in crushing the material.
