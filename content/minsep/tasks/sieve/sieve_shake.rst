Shaking Sieves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Stack the determined sieve sizes. It is best not to go over 4 sieves.
#. Pour sample into the top most sieve so that it covers roughly half of the sieve.
#. Begin gently shaking the sieve side to side. Occasionally gently tap the stack of sieves on a table to knock loosely held grains to the sieve below. Continue to shake until it appears that the finest material has left the topmost sieve.
#. Remove the topmost sieve and place it on the labeled sheet. Continue the shaking motion and continue this process until you have gone through each of the sieves.
#. Once you have gone through each of the sieves and emptied them on to their respective sheets, repeat the process until you have gone through the rest of the sample.
