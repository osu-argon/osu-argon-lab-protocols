## Description

Dilution of acids from concentrate to appropriate normality for acid leaching. In general you will need 500 ml of each of the acids for a standard leach. Below are instructions for making 1 L of the respective acid. Calculations are taken from https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/chemistry/stockroom-reagents/learning-center/technical-library/molarity-calculator.html.

## Procedure

        1. acid_hcl_6n
            a. From a stock solution of 37% w/w (12.178 M).
            b. To make a 6 M solution, slowly add  492.703 mL of the stock solution to 250 mL deionized water. Adjust the final volume of solution to 1000 mL with deionized water.
        2. acid_hcl_1n
            a. From a stock solution of 37% w/w (12.178 M).
            b. To make a 1 M solution, slowly add 82.117 mL of your stock solution to 250 mL deionized water. Adjust the final volume of solution to 1000 mL with deionized water. 
        3. acid_hno3_3n
            a. Your stock solution of Nitric Acid is calculated to be 15.698 M based on a density of 1.413 g/mL, a formula weight of 63.01 g/mol, and a concentration of 70% w/w. 
            b. To make a 3 M solution, slowly add 191.113 mL of your stock solution to 250 mL deionized water. Adjust the final volume of solution to 1000 mL with deionized water.
        4. acid_hno3_1n
            a. Your stock solution of Nitric Acid is calculated to be 15.698 M based on a density of 1.413 g/mL, a formula weight of 63.01 g/mol, and a concentration of 70% w/w. 
            b. To make a 1 M solution, slowly add 63.704 mL of your stock solution to 250 mL deionized water. Adjust the final volume of solution to 1000 mL with deionized water.
