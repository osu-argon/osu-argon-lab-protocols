# sieve_shake

1. Stack the determined sieve sizes. It is best not to go over 4 sieves.
2. Pour sample into the top most sieve so that it covers roughly half of the sieve.
3. Begin gently shaking the sieve side to side. Occasionally gently tap the stack of sieves on a table to knock loosely held grains to the sieve below. Continue to shake until it appears that the finest material has left the topmost sieve.
4. Remove the topmost sieve and place it on the labeled sheet. Continue the shaking motion and continue this process until you have gone through each of the sieves.
5. Once you have gone through each of the sieves and emptied them on to their respective sheets, repeat the process until you have gone through the rest of the sample.
